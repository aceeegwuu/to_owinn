      <p>happy, happy birthday owin!  
      i really hope you enjoy your special day because you truly deserve to be happy.</p>

      <p>i also want to take this chance to be honest about what i feel. i canâ€™t really say that i like you so much yet, since we havenâ€™t had many chances to talk or really get to know each other. itâ€™s always been a little strange for me to like someone right away without really talking to them first. but stillâ€¦ i do have a crush on you, and iâ€™m genuinely interested in getting to know you more.</p>

      <p>maybe it seems like i feel this way because of our past â€” and in a way, those memories still cling to me â€” but what i admire right now is not who you were before, itâ€™s who you are now. itâ€™s not the owin i once fell in love with beforeâ€¦ itâ€™s the sham i admire right now. please donâ€™t think that itâ€™s just because of the past. i admire you for who you are now, and i want you to know that clearly.</p>

      <p>if youâ€™re confused why iris is the song, itâ€™s because this is the song i dedicated to you before, and even until now. the first lyrics of the song already say it all.</p>

      <p>iâ€™m not expecting anything in return, and i donâ€™t want you to feel pressured in any way. you donâ€™t have to force yourself to feel the same. i just wanted to be honest and let you know what i truly feel. if ever iâ€™ll be given the chance to get to know you more, iâ€™d really love that.</p>

      <p>once again, happy birthday owin!  
      i hope your day is filled with love, joy, and all the things that make you happiest.</p>
